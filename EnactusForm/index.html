                <h2>About BIRI</h2>
                <p>We solve all the problems caused by eggshells when they get into the environment
                    - Integrating people with needs into society by providing them with job opportunities and providing
                    a new resource at reasonable prices, at a discount.
                    Benspeth 60%
                    We provide Egyptian companies with calcium chloride at a 60% lower cost.
                    We reduced the use of chemical nutritional supplements and replaced them with natural and beneficial
                    organic supplements.
                    - Producing a natural product of hyaluronic acid and collagen for cosmetic use and also as a natural
                    nutritional supplement.
                    Egypt imports calcium chloride, hyaluronic acid, and collagen, with an import value of about 20
                    million dollars annually. And after what?
                    We turned more and more and studied the market. We found that Egypt imports about 50,000 tons of
                    calcium chloride annually, which we can produce from
                    Egg shells. Egypt also imports about 20 tons of hyaluronic acid and 90 tons of collagen annually. We
                    have thus contributed to
                    The Egyptian economy is very rigid.
                    We provided 600 job opportunities for women and 300 men
                    - We achieved 9 sustainable development goals
                    Total profit: $20,600
                    -Income increased by 200%
                    - The direct impact on people is 5,000 and the indirect impact on people is 30,000
                    - Five production centers, increasing the number of beneficiaries from 900 to 1,700 individuals,
                    producing safer and cheaper products by 60%.
